# Dock

The panel for each module can be undocked to become a floating panel. Floating panels can be resized and moved anywhere within the browser panel. When docking a panel, you return the view to the original view with tabs side by side, or you can dock the panel to create a different view. You can also customize your interface by applying layouts.

There are 4 states that a panel can be in:

- Nest-docked

  Panels form tabbed groupings (also known as tab-docked).

- Docked

  Panels have tabs and share the available space.

- Side-docked

  Panels have title bars and are located at the right or left edges of the screen.

- Floating

  Panels are not docked.
